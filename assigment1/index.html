            I believe the purpose of this assignment was to encourage us to
            engage more critically and thoughtfully with interactive design.
            Rather than focusing solely on aesthetics or functionality, we were
            asked to reflect on how an experience feels, how it shapes user
            behavior, and how it communicates ideas through structure and
            metaphor.

            MyoungAe Kim's portfolio, with its advent calendar-inspired layout,
            invites exploration in a playful and nonlinear way. This challenges
            the typical expectations of a digital portfolio and shows how design
            can be used to guide interaction and create emotional impact.

            I think the lecturer wanted us to understand that interactive media
            isn't just about usability — it's also about storytelling, mood, and
            user engagement over time. It was also likely intended to inspire us
            creatively, showing how digital experiences can break away from
            conventional formats and become more personal, conceptual, and
            meaningful.

          <p>
            The first thing that caught my attention was the
            <strong>grid of numbered boxes</strong> on the homepage. It
            immediately stood out as unusual for a portfolio. Most portfolios
            use thumbnails, categories, or project names — but here, the numbers
            were uniform and abstract. This sparked curiosity. The layout
            reminded me of a <strong>calendar or game board</strong>, evoking a
            sense of discovery. I was visually drawn in, trying to guess what
            could be behind each square, with no immediate clues — just numbers
            inviting me to interact.

            <li>
              Hovered over a few numbers to check for hover animations (subtle

            <li>
              Clicked on box #1 to see what would happen — a project opened in a

            <li>
              Scrolled down within the project to view images, descriptions, and

            <li>
              Read through the project narrative and examined the visuals.

            <li>
              Spent time with the layout and read the textual content again.

            <li>
              Closed the window, returned to grid — randomly clicked on a higher

            </li>
            <li>
              Continued this cycle — opening, reading, closing — noting how each
              experience was unique.
            </li>
            <li>
              Attempted to navigate through a menu, but there was none —

            The individual project panels held my attention the longest. Once a
            numbered square was clicked, the screen transitioned into a
            full-page display of a single project. These were rich in content —
            high-quality images, thoughtful text, and consistent visual styles.
            I found myself absorbed in reading the designer's process and
            examining her use of type, color, motion, or interactivity. The
            contrast between the abstract grid and the rich inner world of each
            project created a satisfying rhythm that made me want to keep
            opening more.

            Clicking on numbered boxes to reveal projects, then returning to the
            grid. That pattern — click, discover, explore, return — became the
            loop of interaction. It felt organic, not forced. There was no need
            to follow an order. It was like a treasure hunt, discovering a new
            layer of her portfolio with each interaction.

          <p>
            The main goal seems to be to create a playful, exploratory space for
            showcasing design work. MyoungAe Kim likely wants users to engage
            with her portfolio not just as viewers, but as active participants,
            navigating intuitively and discovering her work piece by piece. This
            approach mirrors her design philosophy — one that values
            interaction, curiosity, and emotional resonance. It's not just about
            viewing work; it's about experiencing it through micro-surprises and
            personal engagement.

          <p>
            The interface strips away traditional portfolio conventions — no
            menus, no categories, no filters. Instead, the numbered boxes are a
            form of visual metaphor for discovery. There's a gentle gamification
            at play, where each project becomes a reward for your curiosity. The
            design also avoids overwhelming the user — by revealing content one
            piece at a time, the site maintains focus and encourages deeper
            attention to each project. The quiet animations, white space, and
            clean typography all reinforce this sense of calm and focused
            exploration.

          </h3>
          <p>
            It feels designed for multiple, short interactions over time. Like
            an actual advent calendar, it doesn't pressure you to consume
            everything at once. You can open a few boxes, take a break, and come
            back later to continue exploring. This episodic interaction style
            keeps the experience fresh and sustains user curiosity across
            sessions. It respects your attention span — rewarding even brief
            visits — but also encourages returning to explore "what's behind the
            other numbers."

          <p>
            The numbered layout suggests a non-linear, paced approach — you
            aren't meant to binge it like a scrollable feed. The lack of date
            labels, titles, or previews reinforces the idea that each
            interaction is a surprise. The design doesn't enforce urgency or
            completion — there's no progress tracker or notification system.
            Instead, it passively invites you back by leaving mysteries
            unopened. This silent invitation to return is subtle but powerful.

            <li>
              Zines or artistic journals, due to the personal tone and visual

            It tells me I should approach it slowly and curiously, like opening

            pressure to "get through" it — just to enjoy the process of

            each item deserves its own moment, suggesting a one-at-a-time

            The experience communicates a feeling of playfulness, wonder, and
            intimacy. It's designed to make you feel invited, not instructed.
            There's a personal tone to the work — as if the designer is
            whispering, "Here's a piece of me. Go ahead, open it." It encourages
            a sense of wonder and reflection, rather than urgency or information
            gathering.

            The lack of labels or previews can be a double-edged sword. While it
            encourages surprise, it also makes revisiting specific projects
            difficult. If I saw something I liked in box #14 yesterday, I'd have
            to remember the number or go hunting. There's also no search or
            overview, so for someone doing in-depth research or needing to
            quickly locate a project, it might feel inefficient. This limits
            usability for more goal-oriented tasks.

            The moment of reveal — when you click a box and a project smoothly
            slides into view — is deeply satisfying. The contrast between the
            minimal, mysterious homepage and the richly detailed interior
            projects creates a delightful rhythm. It feels like you're being
            rewarded for your curiosity. Additionally, each project has its own
            design personality, so the diversity of experiences adds to the joy
            of exploration.
